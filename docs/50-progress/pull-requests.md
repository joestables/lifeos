## Not yet opened — Docs structure for LifeOS v2

Branch `claude/affectionate-lamport-cukhtr` · 2026-10-09

**What it did**
- Created the `docs/` structure (foundation, requirements, architecture,
  design, operations, roadmap, history) and `CLAUDE.md`, from the redesign
  summary of 8–9 October, which is not kept in the repository. The
  hand-drawn knowledge graph is frozen in `docs/history/`.
- Recorded 36 ADRs: decisions agreed in the redesign discussion, and leans
  as Proposed.
- Added the **Provisionally agreed** ADR status and moved every agreed
  decision to it (Joe is open to changing course while the design is
  young).
- Introduced **Thoughts** (ADR-0037): capture makes a Thought that waits in
  Inbox to be sorted; Notes are organised thoughts. Amended ADR-0005, 0006,
  0007, 0018, 0019, 0023, 0027, 0028 and 0033, and updated every document
  that mentioned Notes as captures.
- Added **one design system, built from shared components** (ADR-0038), set
  up in Stage 1.
- Strengthened the documentation-consistency rules in `docs/README.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md`; added this `50-progress/` folder.
- Added `.claude/settings.json`, pre-approving the Supabase MCP tools under
  both server names, and the rules for Claude running SQL.

**Left for later**
- Joe's review of the Proposed ADRs ([Stage 0 plan](plans/stage-0.md)).
- Stage 2 requirements; context and container diagrams.
